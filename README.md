### 🧠 About Me
I'm a data-driven problem solver passionate about **machine learning**, **data mining**, and **statistical analysis**.  
Currently, I work as a **Teaching Assistant** for the “Intro to Data Analysis” course at **Ariel University**, where I help students bridge the gap between raw data and meaningful insight.

I'm particularly excited about building predictive models, uncovering hidden patterns, and deploying analytical tools that make a real impact.
